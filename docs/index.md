# Preamble {-#preamble}

We are socially fragmented. 

Memory, knowledge, lives, even identities. Everything is dispersed (another argument supporting the non-local consciousness theory). 

The aim of this epistolary work is to know a bit better what I am now thorugh the compilation of pieces of what I have been. I have been told in the past that there was wisdom in the texts I wrote, and I am sure that there is wisdom in the texts I received. 
I hope you find something that makes your life more meaningful and satisfactory. I hope you find a bunch of human beings that, like you, have suffered and have enjoyed moments of their lives. A bunch of human beings that, after all, have lived.

### If you don't know me... {-#intro}

If this is the first time you find out about me, I am Carlos Alcala a.k.a. Carlito Fluito. I like sharing my ideas and experiences through [writing](www.carlitofluitoideas.com), [performing](www.carlitofluito.com), sporadic [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Q8igPq_lE1JQNwbjjy7wA), and spontaneous [Instagram posts](https://www.instagram.com/carlitofluito/?hl=en).

The seriousness of my content varies from "*This guy is crazy!*" to "*It makes sense what he's saying...*". In any case,  As any other human being, I have needs to survive. If you find value in anything I do, and you want to keep me alive^[Or help me growing, let's not be so dramatic.], I will be extremelly grateful if you support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/carlitofluito)^[I am also a qualified psychologist, running online counseling and coaching sessions. Feel free to contact if you are interested in working together.], or drop me a "*Thanks for creating*" message. 

Best, and enjoy reading!!


## A bit of context {-#context}

In September 2019, I started my second year as a Ph.D. student at UCLOuvain, in Belgium. A bit later, I would get involved in a deep and turbulent relationship that made me see life differently. Later on, I change my life path, stop the Ph.D. studies, and dedicate my time and life to become a spiritual psychologist, and a full-time artist. Then, COVID-19 cought me in Berlin...
